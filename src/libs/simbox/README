Functionality:
  - stores matrix of structs, e.g. cells
  - supplies iterators to iterate over core, border and guard of that matrix.
    iterators can be dereferenced to get matrix elements / cells
  - stores arbitrary number of versions of matrix elements which can be 
    cycled through. Thought to be used with timestepping algorithms which need
    to access older timesteps, or just for storing newly calculated data 
    without overwriting current ones by using this as some kind of swap feature
        TIMESTEPS_NEEDED_FOR_CALCULATION
    If above is set to 2, it basically acts as a swap or double buffer
